# Home Depot(家得宝)'s Failure in China

## I. Introduction of Home Depot

Founded in 1978, Home Depot, Inc. is the world's largest home improvement specialty retailer, and the fourth-largest retailer in the United States. The company's fiscal 2010 retail sales were $68.0 billion, and earnings from continuing operations were $3.3 billion. Currently, the company has more than 2,200 retail stores in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and China. The company was ranked No. 30 on the Fortune 500 list in 2010.

## II. China Experience

Home Depot entered China in 2006 by acquiring 12 stores from the Chinese home improvement company Home Way, China's first big-box(大卖场) home improvement retailer. 

In 2006, Home Depot employed 3,000 associates and operated 12 stores across six cities in China—Tianjin (5), Beijing (2), Xi'an (2), Qingdao (1), Shenyang (1), and Zhengzhou (1). Tianjin was the anchor city because it was the headquarters of Home Way. 

Home Depot China's store format was big-box operation, with an average of 90,000 square feet per store, based on a DIY model developed in the United States. The stores offer such services as delivery, installation, design, and remodeling. The Chinese translation for Home Depot is “Jia De Bao (equation image),” which literally means “getting treasures for your home”.

In May 2009 Home Depot suddenly closed its storefront in Qingdao. On September 15, 2012, the Wall Street Journal reported that Home Depot Inc. decided to close all seven of its remaining big-box stores in China and to pull out of China after six years of losses. Home Depot joins a growing list of American retailers who have stumbled in China. 

## III. Related Materials

The following are some analysis materials quoted from a research report.

(1) From 2006 to 2012, Home Depot applied its American DIY business model almost without modification to China: its stores were operated on a big-box format located mostly at the outskirts of Chinese cities; its display of store merchandise required customers with substantial knowledge for self-work; and its advertising format was mailing printed flyers to customers. 

(2) Home Depot should have identified contractors(装修承包商) as a key segment of market in China. Li, a retired military officer, was a regular customer at Home Depot. In 2010, Li paid 6,000 yuan ($909) to the Home Depot Beijing store for a bathtub and cupboard for her condo in Beijing. She said she did not like Home Depot's big-box superstore culture. “I think most Chinese prefer hiring a decoration company rather than going the do-it-yourself way … and shopping assistants here are not enthusiastic about giving advice as I need help to understand the differences among various brands. Most shop assistants only promote the brands that they are paid to represent.”

(3) Who are the target customers for Home Depot? The target customers for international retailers such as Home Depot are the new-generation urban dwellers in first- and second-tier cities. The Chinese middle class consumers are fond of Western name brands and luxury products. Home Depot should have redesigned its image and packaged its products and services that carry the cache of “luxury from America.”  

(4) Homes purchased in Chinese cities are primarily unfinished condos, and need to be completed by professionals, as a comprehensive project. Most customers do not do it themselves in terms of shopping for building materials and fixing up the condos. They want to hire others to complete their home improvement projects.

(5) The Chinese home-improvement market is heavily fragmented. The top three home improvement companies combined occupy only 3% of the total Chinese home improvement market. 

(6) There are many “gray areas” of doing business in China. As a US company bound by US laws, Home Depot cannot utilize the “gray channels” that Chinese firms use to secure government or business favors by paying them with fat gifts and commissions. 

(7) In Chinese home improvement stores, the price of virtually everything is up for negotiation between the seller and buyer on the spot, similar to a flea market. Most Chinese homeowners hire designers to shop for building materials. When designers buy tiles from a Chinese home improvement store, they receive cash bonuses on the spot. This is the system that Home Depot is up against in China, where business depends on “guanxi” (long-term reciprocal connections, equation image) and under-the-table commissions.

(8) Middle-class Chinese customers usually live in downtown areas in metropolitan Chinese cities. However, based on Home Depot's DIY model borrowed from the United States, Home Depot stores were located mostly in the suburbs, not in downtown. In Beijing, Home Depot had only one functional store in 2010 (this store was closed in January 2011). The store was on the fourth ring road, far away from the downtown, hidden behind trees. To drive from one end of the city to the other usually takes two to three hours in Beijing. Who would like to take a taxi for two to three hours to this one Home Depot store to buy a lightbulb?

(9) With such a limited number of stores (12 stores in four cities in 2006 and then 7 stores in three cities in 2011, and now all closed), the percentage of market share for Home Depot in China was negligible. As a result, suppliers were unwilling to strike deals, and thus Home Depot prices were not competitive for price-conscious Chinese customers. Many Chinese suppliers were aware of the fact that Home Depot was a Fortune 500 company, but when they compared Home Depot to its foreign and Chinese competitors in China regarding sales volume, they chose not to favor Home Depot.

(10) Labor is cheap in China. In a nation with a sizable pool of unskilled labor and countless small-time construction companies, it is simply more convenient and cheaper to outsource such manual labor jobs as home improvement. As a result, most Chinese consumers do not Do-It-Themselves on home improvement. They choose to hire contractors.

(11) In 1975, China adopted the “One Child Policy” as a national regulation for population control, with urban dwellers allowed only one child per couple. These only children, the “little emperors and empresses” of China, are now in their 20s, 30s, and approaching their 40s. They are the vital components of international retailers' target consumers in China. Most of these only children become homeowners when they get married, usually with financial contributions from their parents. These only children have been somewhat spoiled by their two parents and four grandparents, and have normally not done much manual labor work growing up in urban China.

## Answers

First, this research stresses the importance of host culture in creating a business model when an international retailer expands to a foreign country.

This research suggests that Home Depot could have replaced its ineffective DIY (Do-It-Yourself) model with the new DIFM (Do-It-for-Me) business model for China.

This article uses the Home Depot's operation in China as a case study to stress that “culture” determines business models for international retailers. 

This research shows that the mentality of Chinese middle-class consumers does not support Home Depot's DIY business model.

First, there is a “social status issue” concerning the DIY model. Since antiquity, manual labor has been looked down upon in China. Only lower-class citizens have to deal with manual labor. 

Consumers in China tend to trust Western brands more because there are so many counterfeits in China. However, Home Depot as a brand was basically unknown in China. Visiting China in August 2010, the author had great difficulty finding the Home Depot store in Beijing, and most taxi drivers had never heard of Home Depot.

First, this research stresses the importance of host culture in creating a business model when an international retailer expands to a foreign country. Second, the research develops a new Host Culture Analysis Framework: CELM. Third, by applying the CELM framework to the Chinese market, this research creates a new DIFM business model for Home Depot China, to be viewed as an example for any international retailer. Fourth, this article proposes a new UBS retail format for international retailers entering emerging markets. Finally, this research shows that in-depth interview is a solid research method to be applied to case studies for the discovery of deeper reasons of international expansion failures.
